### Rimmel's Natural Bronzer is the new cult fave for believable bronze on a serious budget

Rimmel's Natural Bronzer delivers a sun-kissed glow without sun exposure. This velvety powder bronzer imparts natural-looking radiance and warmth with a matte, non-shimmer finish. The lightweight, blendable formula applies smoothly and evenly for a beautiful bronze that looks like your own tan. Available in versatile shades that complement various skin tones. With its waterproof staying power and budget-friendly price, this bronzer lets you achieve a vacation glow for less.

Widely considered an amazing dupe for Benefit Cosmetics’ Hoola Bronzer, Rimmel’s Natural Bronzer offers strikingly similar results for a fraction of the price. Providing the same natural matte bronze finish, the $4 Rimmel bronzer measures up impressively to the $30 Benefit original. Reviewers insist the budget powder gives the same ultra-blendable, easy bronze as the Benefit bronzer for almost 90% less. For a believable bronze glow on a budget, this bronzer is unbeatable.
