### Beauty stans are head over heels for The Ordinary's Cold-Pressed Virgin Marula Oil

The Ordinary's 100% Cold-Pressed Virgin Marula Oil provides pure, antioxidant-rich hydration. This lightweight face oil contains 100% unrefined marula oil that absorbs quickly to nourish skin. Rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants, the pure marula oil boosts radiance and softness. The cruelty-free formula rejuvenates dry skin by locking in moisture without clogging pores. Just a few drops of this budget-friendly oil leave your complexion glowy and renewed.
