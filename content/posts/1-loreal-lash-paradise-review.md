### L'Oreal's Lash Paradise Mascara is the obsessed over budget buy for falsie-worthy fluttery lashes.

L’Oreal Lash Paradise Mascara dramatically volumizes lashes for an eye-opening look. The ultra-soft wavy brush evenly coats lashes from root to tip for clump-free intense length and volume. The conditioning formula adheres to lashes to prevent flaking and smudging. One coat creates visible lift while additional coats build bold, fanned-out fringe. This $12 mascara helps you achieve attention-grabbing lashes on a budget.

Widely considered the perfect dupe for Too Faced’s Better Than Sex Mascara, Lash Paradise Mascara offers the same false lash effect for far less. Providing the same smudge-proof, intense volumizing and curling, this mascara is indistinguishable from the high-end version according to reviews. But the L’Oreal dupe costs just $12 compared to $28 for Too Faced's mascara. If you love intense, fluttery lashes, the wallet-friendly Lash Paradise Mascara is a total steal.
